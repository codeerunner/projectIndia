           <strong>India </strong> is a beautiful land with a variety of wildlife and rich cultural diversity.
             The Bengal Tiger is considered the national animal of India. India celebrates
            its Independence Day on <A href="./index2.html">15th August</A> every year. It is observed to commemorate 
            the freedom of India from the British. The tri-coloured national flag is called 
            Tiranga, designed with saffron, white and green with the Ashok Chakra in navy 
            blue at the centre of the flag. ‘Lion Capital of Ashoka’ is the country’s national
             emblem. The national motto is ‘Satyameva Jayate,’ which means truth alone wins.

            In order to run the country smoothly, and make it an independent country, there was
             a need for a constitution which came into force on 26th January 1950. We observe this
              day as Republic Day every year.
            
            India is a land of many different languages and many different religions such as
            Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Hinduism, etc. There are various food styles and dressing
            styles depending on the regions of the country, setting the perfect example of Unity in Diversity.
